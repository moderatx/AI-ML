    "# Credit Card Default Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll build and evaluate a machine‑learning model that tries to answer a simple question: given a client's history, will they default on their next credit card payment? Accurately anticipating defaults helps banks reduce losses and adjust credit policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be working with the \"Default of Credit Card Clients\" dataset from Taiwan (2005). Each of the 30,000 rows describes one customer, including demographic information, credit limits, six months of bill statements and payments, and whether the customer defaulted the following month. Our goal is to train a model that takes in these inputs and predicts the binary target `DefaultNextMonth`."

    "## Exploring the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before training any models, it's helpful to understand what the dataset looks like and clean up any quirks. The data file contains 30,000 rows and 25 columns (including the target). Some of the variables, such as `SEX`, `EDUCATION`, and `MARRIAGE`, are stored as integer codes rather than descriptive labels. The target column `DefaultNextMonth` is also imbalanced: roughly 22 % of customers in this sample defaulted on their next payment, so naïvely predicting \"no default\" would still be correct most of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few other points worth noting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The education variable includes undocumented codes 0, 5 and 6. We'll map all of these to a single \"Other\" category, represented by code 4.\n",
    "- Similarly, the marriage variable occasionally takes the value 0, which isn't defined in the data dictionary; we'll map it to the \"Other\" category (code 3).\n",
    "- Payment status columns `PAY_1`–`PAY_6` use −2 to denote a month with no transaction and −1 to denote an on‑time payment. We'll treat both values as a single 'no delay' indicator (−1).\n",
    "- Occasionally a customer over‑pays, leading to negative bill amounts. We'll leave those values untouched.\n",
    "- We'll create two simple summary features: **`AVG_BILL_AMT`** (the average of the six `BILL_AMT` columns) and **`AVG_PAY_AMT`** (the average of the six `PAY_AMT` columns). These average values capture the typical monthly bill and payment amount for each client.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the data cleaned up, we'll split the dataset into training, validation and test sets using stratified sampling to maintain the class proportions. Because the default cases are scarce, we'll either apply class weighting or oversample the minority class when training models. Continuous variables will be standardised (zero mean and unit variance), and categorical variables will be converted to one‑hot encoded columns so that algorithms can handle them properly."

    "## Results and discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "After preparing the data, we'll train two different classifiers to predict credit default and compare their performance on the held‑out test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logistic regression**: This simple, interpretable model uses class weighting to account for the imbalanced target. In my experiments, it achieves an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of about 0.72 and recall of roughly 0.61 on the test set. In other words, it correctly identifies about 61 % of defaulters but doesn't distinguish high‑risk customers particularly well.\n",
    "- **Multi‑layer perceptron (MLP)**: This neural network with two hidden layers is trained on a balanced version of the training data created by oversampling defaulters. It performs better than logistic regression: the test AUC rises to about 0.77, and recall improves to about 0.66. Precision remains modest (~0.42), meaning many non‑defaulters are flagged as risky, but the bank can adjust the decision threshold depending on how cautious they want to be. The confusion matrix shows that the MLP correctly classifies most non‑defaulters while catching about two‑thirds of the defaulters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What worked well\n",
    "\n",
    "- Starting with a careful exploration of the data helped us catch anomalies and create a couple of simple, informative features.\n",
    "- Using separate training, validation and test splits allowed us to tune models without overfitting and to evaluate generalisation.\n",
    "- The MLP improved both AUC and recall compared with the baseline logistic model, highlighting the benefit of a more expressive classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What could be improved\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even the neural network misses many defaulters and produces a fair number of false positives. Adding more informative variables (such as income, employment or credit history from other financial products) or experimenting with ensemble methods (like gradient boosting) could help.\n",
    "- Neural networks are essentially black boxes; to deploy them responsibly, we'd need to compute feature importances or use tools like SHAP or LIME to explain individual predictions.\n",
    "- In this notebook, we treat the payment status variables as ordinal integers. One‑hot encoding these variables might uncover non‑linear relationships, but it would also increase the dimensionality and training complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, a bank would monitor model performance over time, adjust the prediction threshold based on the real cost of defaults versus false alarms, and periodically retrain the model as economic conditions and customer behaviour change."
