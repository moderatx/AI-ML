# Credit Card Default Dataset Exploration

The script:

* Loads a CSV file converted from the original XLS dataset
* Cleans and renames columns for clarity
* Shows dataset structure and sample rows
* Analyzes the class distribution of credit card default
* Visualizes the default vs non-default distributio



## Requirements

 Python 3 should be installed, then install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```



## How to make it work

 Place the CSV file in the same directory as the script
 Run the script:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```
